# blog
Little blog website for yourself. \
I'm not the best at PHP or databases or whatever, this was just a project to learn the both :-]

# Setting up
 * Install a webserver, php, and the php sqlite3 extension. For debian this is `apache2 php php-sqlite3` 
 * Copy the project files into the folder you're using for hosting websites. This is probably `/var/www/html`
 * Open the `initdb.php` file from your web server. If you're doing it from your current machine this is `localhost/initdb.php`
 * Delete the `initdb.php` file.
 * Change the password in `createpost.php`.
 * You should be ready now!
